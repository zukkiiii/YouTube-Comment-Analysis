# YouTube-Comment-Analysis
This project is the final project of my thesis to get a bachelor's degree. I hope it can become a reference for those who want to do something similar.

What I did with this project was to analyze comments on YouTube regarding the development of Covid-19 in Indonesia. The steps taken are data collection, data pre-processing, and data processing using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).
